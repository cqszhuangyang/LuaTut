Lua Tutorial project.
====================

This code is based on the code supplied by Viktor Lidholt in the 
CocosDragon CocosBuilder tutorial:

https://github.com/vlidholt/CocosDragon/blob/master/Tutorial/Tutorial.md

I have typed in code from that tutorial and made my own modifications.

It includes open-source components including Cocos2D and CocosBuilder
as specified in the licences and README files in those respective
directories.

The code in the tutorial itself is covered by this license shown in the
headers of the files at the above URL:

It also includes some attribution licensed graphics and audio as specified
in the files:
* LuaTut/Resources/ArtAndMusicCredits.rtf
* LuaTut/Resouces/Credits.plist
The Credits.plist file is displayed on the game screen on startup.

The code has been modified from the tutorial by me (sarah@smithsoft.com.au)
for use as a tutorial on integrating Lua into a game.  This tutorial
project will be the subject of a talk I'm giving and possibly a future
video tutorial.  It is not for profit.  My modifications are placed into
the public domain: please use as desired subject to the original authors
license shown above.

All other properties, code and graphics are covered by the licenses as
included and must be attributed or licensed as such.
